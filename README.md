# ml_examples

Small machine learning programs and examples built with numpy; sklearn used for benchmark scores only.

these are not built to be computationally efficient (obviously, if you run them) but rather to get a better handle on how things work.

### models:
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. In progress: perceptron
